The Cricket Data Analyticsüèè project is made on T-20 Cricket World Cup Data. I have used **Power BI** for making the Dashboard. We can easily analyse the data of the matches played in the world cup. We can also choose our best playing 11 from the pool of players playing the world cup. 

> To interact with the dashboard you can download the pbix file from the repository and open it in Power BI Desktop locally.

# Steps involved in the project:

1. üìùRequirement Scoping
2. üåêData Collection using Web Scraping from [ESPN Cricinfo](http://www.espn.in/cricket/) website
3. üßπData Cleaning and Preprocessing in Pandas
4. ü™ÑData Transformation in Power Query
5. ‚öíÔ∏èData Modelling and Building Parameters in Power BI using DAX
6. üìäBuilding the Dashboard in Power BI



## Problem Statement :

In This project we created a Power BI Dashboard which helps to review and compare performances of all the players in T20 Men's Cricket World Cup 2022 tournament. This dashboard also enables us to select the best 11 of the tournament based on their performance based on defined selection criteria which is included as a part of problem statement.

## Datasource :

Scrapped all the data regarding match and world cup from www.espncricinfo.com and all details of player career performace and collect data on [brightdata](https://brightdata.com/)

## Data Collection:
Scrapped all the data regarding match and world cup and all details about players career from [brightdata](https://brightdata.com/) using Beautiful Soup library and Jupyter Notebook is used to convert the json files into the dataframes and then these dataframes into csv file for further data analysis on power bi.

## Data Transformation:
Performed initial data cleaning after scrapping such as player name correction, handle missing value, match id linking etc. using Pandas. Transformed the final data for dashboard using Power Query of Power BI.

## Data Modelling:
Connected all the datasets with based on some defined primary keys such as team and match ids. Also, created many measures, calculated columns and parameters for data analysis and dash boarding using DAX.

## Data Analysis Expression (DAX)
Measures used in visualization are:

- Total Runs = `SUM(t20_batting_summary[runs])`

- Total Innings Batted =`COUNT(t20_batting_summary[matchID])`

- Total Innings Dismissed = `SUM(t20_batting_summary[Out])`

- Batting Avg = `DIVIDE([Total Runs],[Total Innings Dismissed],0)`

- Total balls faced =`SUM(t20_batting_summary[balls])`

- Strike rate = `DIVIDE([Total Runs],[total balls faced],0)*100`

- Batting Possition = `ROUNDUP(AVERAGE(t20_batting_summary[battingPos]),0)`

- Boundary % = `DIVIDE(SUM(t20_batting_summary[Boundary runs]),[Total Runs],0)*100`

- Avg. balls faced = ` AVERAGE(t20_batting_summary[balls])`

- wickets = `SUM(t20_bowling_summary[wickets])`

- Balls Bowled = `SUM(t20_bowling_summary[balls])`

- Runs Conced = `SUM(t20_bowling_summary[runs])`

- Economy = `DIVIDE([Runs Conced],([Balls Bowled]/6),0)`

- Bowling Strike Rate =`DIVIDE([Balls Bowled],[wickets],0)`

- Bowling Avrage = `DIVIDE([Runs Conced],[wickets],0)`

- Total Innings Bowled = `DISTINCTCOUNT(t20_bowling_summary[matchID])`

- Dot Ball % =` DIVIDE(SUM(t20_bowling_summary[zeros]),SUM(t20_bowling_summary[balls]),0)`

- Player selection = `if(ISFILTERED(t20_players_info[name]),"1","0")`

- Display Text = `if([Player selection] = "1"," ","Select Player(s) by clicking the player's name to see their invidual or combined strength")`

- Color Callout Value =`if([Player selection]="0","#E8D166","#1D1D2E")`

- boundary runs batting =`t20_batting_summary[fours]*4 + t20_batting_summary[sixes]*6`

- boundary runs bowling =`t20_bowling_summary[fours]*4+t20_bowling_summary[sixes]*6`
